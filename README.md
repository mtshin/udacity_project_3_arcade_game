# Udacity Project 3 - Arcade Game

This project is a browser-based arcade game resembling the classic *Frogger*. It was a requirement for the 2019 Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program.

## Game Mechanics

The objective of the game is to move the player model with keyboard arrow keys up to the river while avoiding the bugs.

The game timer begins when the player makes the first step. Game metrics are shown on the modal upon this victory condition.

This game can be on [this repo's GitHub hosted page](https://mtshin.github.io/udacity_project_3_arcade_game/).
